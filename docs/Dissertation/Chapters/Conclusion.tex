\chapter{Conclusion}

A great project!

\section{Future Work}
This section discusses possible future additions our team, or another team, could potentially add to the plugin in future years. 

\subsection{Parser Generator}
In the initial meetings with our client, Dr Simon Gay, he specifically stated that our toolkit was not to parse the grammars created; it was instead to export the grammar into formats that could be parsed by popular parsers such as ANTLR and Yacc. He explained that this was due to time constraints and the level of difficulty in implementing such a feature on top of the already specified toolkit. For a future project team studying Computing Science. this could be a possible feature to implement, as it would allow the team to learn more about how grammars are parsed into a useable format. It would also be a great project for our own members as it would allow our members to revisit our project and implement a feature we had all discussed as a possibility. 

\subsection{Code Formatter}
Currently our team members are satisfied with the state of the Code Formatter.
