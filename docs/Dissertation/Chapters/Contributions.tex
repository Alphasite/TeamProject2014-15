\section{Contributions}

Here we explain that Lewis Carroll wrote chapter \ref{intro}. John Wayne
was out riding his horse every day and didn't do anything. Marilyn Monroe
was great at getting the requirements specification and coordinating the
writing of the report. Betty Davis did the coding of the kernel of the
project, described in Chapter \ref{impl}.  James Dean handled the
multimedia content of the project.
